### 1) Bleep
* Write a function that takes in a word and a paragraph. 
* Every instance of this word should be replaced with asterisks (it "bleeps" the word). 
* Use a reference to the paragraph input variable to alter it from within the function without a return.git 

### 2) Hanoi  
Towers of Hanoi is a simple game consisting of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.  
  
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:  
  
* Only one disk can be moved at a time.
* Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
* No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
